        <h2>Managing Philosophy</h2>
        <p>With 5 years experience in managing personnel, I feel that I am a good fit for managing small 
          to medium size teams. While managing at Target, my roster had a lower turnover in staff than the 
          previous five years before I was hired. I believe my key to being a successful manager is my ability
           to be an active listener. I don’t just let my colleagues speak, I really care about what they’re 
           saying. I know the best way to motivate my team is to make everyone feel heard, no matter their 
           role or responsibilites.  In addition to being an active listener, I am very goal-oriented. I get 
           very much satisfaction from surpassing the goals put in front of me. During my second year working 
           for 3M, I was told to cut total food costs by 4%. After consulting with the chefs, we devised a plan 
           which ended up cutting food costs by 6%. What we first thought would be quite a difficult challenge 
           wound up being a big reason for more organization and preparation procedures that are still in place 
           today. My outlook on managing is being the manager you would want to work for yourself.</p>

    <!--  SECTION 2  -->

    <section id="section2" data-nav="Friendly Attitude">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Friendly Attitude</h2>
        <p>Just like managing or learning financing, kindness is a skill that takes practice and time to 
          develop. In my opinion, being friendly in the office is one of the most underrated traits when 
          searching for employees. I enjoy greeting everyone in the office with a smile and hello. I think 
          it’s important to show my colleagues that I am always open for discussion, help, and communication. 
          By doing this, I find colleagues enjoy being around me and are often infected by my upbeat attitude.
          Since I spend so much of my day working, I make the effort to be cheerful and try to make connections 
          with as many colleagues as possible. I think the impression I leave on my colleagues is just as important 
          as how I manage or what I accomplish.</p>

    <!--  SECTION 3  -->

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Organization First">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Organization First</h2>
        <p>At every role I have had, a key to my success has been a high level of organization. It is a must 
          in any office job and it is something I have been trying to perfect since I was in high-school. I 
          am a big supporter of charts, lists, graphs, whiteboards, and any other tool that a team of 
          colleagues can view together so that everyone can stay one the same page in regards to what needs 
          to be done. While at Target, I was invited to a corporate summit to discuss logistics procedures 
          where we discussed methods to make unloading inbound stock more efficient. The old method involved 
          pallets based on type of goods, whereas my team’s plan involved trolley carts where stock could be 
          unloaded and organized by aisle. After trying this method out in our store for three months, it 
          saved our employees an average of 40 minutes per trailer and was adapted to be the new sorting 
          system nationwide. Every time I begin a new role, my first step is always implementing a plan for 
          myself to make my day-to-day operations as organized as possible.</p>

    <!--  SECTION 4  -->

    <section id="section4" data-nav="Qualifications & History">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Qualifications & History</h2>
        <p>Now that you’ve read about my key traits and abilities, allow me to tell you about myself and my 
          background. In high school, I was a three-sport athlete and a member of the student council. I 
          graduated one year early and started my study at Le Cordon Bleu-Chicago where I studied restaurant 
          management with a minor in business management. During my study, I completed two internships as 
          assistant manager at two separate restaurants in Chicago; Community Tavern and Boka.</p>

        <p>After completing my degree, I was immediately hired by 3M Wonewok as culinary manager where I 
          worked closely with the chefs and drink staff to deliver an outstanding experience for our guests. 
          Following three years working for 3M, I decided to relocate closer to my immediate family and I 
          began my role at Target as a store manager. This was my first role ever in logistics, and it 
          provided me with the opportunity to become a more well-rounded manager and gain experience in 
          day-to-day logistical operations. </p>

        <p>Once I had been working for Target for seventeen months, I decided to come to The Netherlands 
          and get married to my long-time girlfriend who is a Dutch citizen. In my time here, I have been 
          lucky to learn Dutch, and I have had a great business relationship with my prior employer as an 
          executive assistant. While with Mobike, I assisted the CEO and other executives with daily tasks 
          and had the responsibility of securing travel and preparing appointments for the executives. 
          Recently, Mobike decided to liquidate the company.</p>

        <p>This left me looking for my next opportunity. I have since started studying web development and 
          am looking for a role where I can continue to grow while completing my study.
